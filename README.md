User Defined Functions in R


This repository contains user defined functions in R that I created. These were created to satisfy different needs, which I have described in detail in my article mentioned below:

TemperatureConversion: This is a UDF that contains 'if conditions' and built in functions
UDF_WithForLoops: This UDF utilises 'for loop' to get a monthly aggregated data
UDFs_within_UDFs: Here I have demonstrated how a UDF can be embedded within another UDF for better optimisation
